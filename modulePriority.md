## Purpose

This file serves as a priority list for what material you should focus on understanding, and what is less important. You should, given time, strive to understand and master all of the material covered in the class, but it's understood that this is not always possible for students with busy schedules.

## High Priority

The items here are important to know and grasp. Not having an understanding of these items will hamper your progress in the class.

* Module 1 - Everything in this module
* Module 2 - Everything in this module *except* pseudo elements
* Module 3 - Everything in this module. This module is the basic concepts of JavaScript, which almost every other module in the class will build on.
* Module 4 - Everything in this module
* Module 5 - Moment and Google Fonts
* Module 6 - Fetch
* Module 10 - Promises, Classes

## Medium Priority

The items here are good to know as they will help you have a better toolkit for handling challenges, but if you're missing a few of them, it's not a super big deal.

* Module 2 - Pseudo elements. These are handy to know about, but we can use JavaScript to do the same actions.
* Module 5 - Bootstrap. It's nice to know, but you can pick it up as necessary.
* Module 9 - Everything in this module is important to know by sight, but not necessarily understand completely. You will run across this code during your career, and you should be able to understand what it is.
* Module 10 - Functional Constructors, Testing. Testing is important, and you should learn the basics, but make sure you have a good grasp of JS fundamentals first.

## Low Priority

The items here are generally presented for historical purposes and can be skipped if you don't have the time. You may still run into them in your career though.

* Module 5 - jQuery. It's handy, but not as popular as it was before. Learn it if you like it, but it's not required.
* Module 6 - jQuery AJAX function and XHR
* Module 10 - Prototypes and Polymorphism
