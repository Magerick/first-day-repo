## Usage

This document is meant to give the definition of some common terms that you might hear as a software developer. It is by no means exhaustive

## Table of Contents

[[_TOC_]]


## A

* Anonymous Function - A Function with no name. Less commonly referred to as a Method.
* Asynchronous - Refers to a way of architecting tasks in such a way that multiple tasks can be done at the same time. Often referred to as "async"

## C

* Call - In reference to a Function, to "call a function" means to write code that tells JavaScript to enter that function and execute its contents.
* Class - Another way of structuring and creating Objects, Classes allow you to group together similar code.
* Code - Code can refer to a few things:
    * A section of text that is intended to be run by a interpreter or compiler. "I'm writing some code"
    * The overall files and configuration that make up a software project. "I'm going to take a look in the code"
* Command Line - A text-only method of interacting with your computer. This is a common place for developers to be found.
* Compiler - A program that takes Code and compiles it into a binary form that can be read by a computer
* Compiled Language - A programming language that must be compiled via a Compiler before it can be run
* Constant - A Variable that cannot have its value changed once it is set.
* Constructor - A function that creates an object. Usually invoked with the `new` keyword.
* Config - Short for Configuration. Config refers to text that is not code, but is used by a program to effect how it runs. "Take a look at the config".
* Config File - A file that contains primarily Config
* Conditional - A structure of code that allows execution of some other code, if and only if the requirements of the conditional are met.
* Console - A program that allows access to the command-line. It is generally text only. Many developer tools only work in the terminal. See also: Terminal

## F

* Function - A section of code that can be run multiple times without having to duplicate the code. Often functions have parameters that can affect their behavior.

## I

* IDE - Short for Integrated Development Environment. This refers to a program that lets you write code, run a terminal, debug, and handle version control all from one place. The more popular ones have plugin systems that increase functionality. VS Code is a popular example.
* Inheritance - The process by which a Class inherits methods and data from another Class. This can be used to build reusable Classes that provide generic functionality.
* Interpreter - A program that takes in code and runs it on the spot, without compiling it.
* Interpreted Language - A programming language that is run via an Interpreter
* Iterate - This is a fancy word that means "to loop over". So for instance "Iterate over the array" means "loop over every element in the array"

## J

* JavaScript - A very popular programming language that started life in web browsers, but has now moved to servers, desktop applications, and even mobile devices. Not to be confused with Java. See also: JScript
* JScript - An extremely uncommon way of referring to JavaScript. See also: JavaScript

## L

* Loop - Any structure of code that can be repeated multiple times without having to duplicate the code.

## M

* Method - In JavaScript, this is a Function that has no name (also known as an anonymous function).
* Mock - An object that is used to replace an existing function or module in the code so that tests can be written more easily. Mocks are often used to prevent third party libraries from actually being called.

## P

* Polymorphism - The concept of a function that performs differently if given a different number of parameters, or if given different types of arguments to its parameters.
* Promise - In JavaScript, this is a language feature that handles waiting on an Asynchronous process to finish.
* Prototype - In JavaScript, this refers to the collection of functions and other properties added onto a Class after the Class has been defined.

## S

* Script - Usually refers to a single file that contains Code. Usually used only if the Code is from an Interpreted Language
* Synchronous - Refers to tasks that must be completed in order, and one thing must wait for the previous to be done before it can start. Often referred to as "sync"

## T

* TDD - Short for Test Driven Design. A method of developing that involves writing the tests first, then the code that makes them pass.
* Terminal - A program that allows access to the command-line. It is generally text only. Many developer tools only work in the terminal. See also: Console

## V

* Variable - A reference to stored data. A variable generally has a name, which can be used to refer to the data it stores.
* Version Control - A method of managing code changes that allows a history of what changes were made. Can also provide mechanisms for ensuring people don't stomp on each others changes.
* Version Control System - A program that provides Version Control management of code. Git is a popular Version Control System.
